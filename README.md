# BookStore - MERN Stack E-commerce Application

## Project Overview

BookStore is an e-commerce application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to browse, view details, and purchase books. Additionally, it includes an admin panel where administrators can manage the collection of books, including adding, updating, and deleting book entries. Firebase is used for authentication to secure both user and admin access.

## Features

### User Features:
- **Browse Books**: Users can browse through a list of available books.
- **View Book Details**: Clicking on a book displays its detailed information.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using Firebase authentication.

### Admin Features:
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can access a panel to manage the book inventory.
- **Add New Books**: Admins can upload new books, including details such as title, author, price, and description.
- **Edit Books**: Admins can update the details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Admins can remove books from the inventory.
